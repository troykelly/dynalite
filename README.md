Dynalite Notes, Scripts and Examples
Not authorised or affiliated with Philips in any way - this just exists out of frustration due to the lack of documentation surrounding Dynalite.
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/troykelly/dynalite/wiki) - it has all the information you are after - if it does not - you can add it!
